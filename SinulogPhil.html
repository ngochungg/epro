                    Sinulog Festival in Cebu: <br>Everything You Need to Know</b></h2>
                <p>Sinulog Festival or Santo Nino Festival is an annual religious and cultural festival in <b>Cebu</b>
                    . The festival is thought to be the first of the most well-known festivals in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>It also attracts between 1 to 2 million visitors from all over the country every year and gives travelers the opportunity to join Cebu tours to explore
                     the province.</p>
                <p>Besides the religious part of the celebration, Sinulog is also well-known for its street parties before the day of celebration and 
                    during the day of the festival.</p>
                <p><b>History of Sinulog Festival</b></p>
                <p>Sinulog is held in celebration of one of the country’s most famous historic relics: the Santo Niño de Cebú. This was the statue of the baby Jesus that was handed to the Rajah Humabon of Cebu by the Portuguese 
                    explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.</p>
                <p> This was one of the most important events in the religious history of the Philippines as it paved the way to the birth of Christianity 
                    in the country.</p>

                <p><br>At the moment of receiving the holy image, it was said that Queen Juana, the main consort of Rajah Humabon, danced with 
                    joy holding this image of the child Jesus.</p>
                <p>The other natives followed her example, and this event was regarded as the first Sinulog dance. The same event 
                    was used as the basis for most Sinulog dances.</p>
                <p>The Sinulog dance steps are also believed to originate from Baladhay, Rajah Humabon's adviser. When Baladhay got sick, Humabon ordered his tribe to bring Baladhay 
                    into a room where the Santo Niño was enthroned.</p>
                <p>After a few days, Baladhay was heard shouting and was found dancing by the native tribe. Baladhay was asked as to why was he was shouting and dancing. He pointed at the image of the holy 
                    Jesus and explained that baby Jesus was tickling him.</p>
                <p>In turn, Baladhay danced with the little child and explained that he was dancing the movements of the river. To this day, the two-steps forward, the one-step backward movement is still used by Santo Niño devotees who believe that it was 
                    the Santo Niño's choice to have Baladhay dance.</p>

                <p><b><br>Meaning of Sinulog</b></p>
                <p>Sinulog comes from the Cebuano word “sulog” which means “like water current movement” which depicts 
                    the forward-backward step of Sinulog dance.</p>
                <p><b>When is Sinulog celebrated?</b></p>
                <p>Sinulog Festival is held every third Sunday of January. For 2020, it falls on the 19th of January.  This is why it's highly recommended to go to Cebu a few days before the Sinulog festival and stay for a couple more to fully 
                    experience the events and also explore the province. </p>
