                <h2><b>Lechon Festival</b></h2>
                <p>The Lechon Festival in the town of Balayan is one of the most-awaited festivities in the Philippines. People across the world would come to Balayan just to experience 
                    this exhilarating festival.</p>
                <p>Held every <b>June 24</b> in honor of St. John the Baptist, the day starts pretty early as the streets are already filled with festivities, with people dancing along with visitors from all over the world. The local government and residents prepare nothing but tons of exciting activities for everyone to enjoy—street dancing, Parada ng Lechon (lechon parade) where the main star of the event is not represented by actual people—although dressed up like one, and the most exciting part, 
                    basaan (water dousing).</p>
                <p>And while the locals test the patience of passers-by, the mood is mostly filled with delight which is always 
                    evident in everyone’s faces. </p>
                <p><b>What to do at the Lechon Festival</b></p>
                <P>Here are some of the most exciting things to do at Lechon Festival:</P>
                <P><b>1. Watch the Parada ng Lechon<br></b></P>
                <img src="/./Season/Summer/Phil/lechon2.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; position: relative; left: 165px;">
                <p><br>One of the most-awaited events and the main highlight of the festival is the lechon parade. Many roasted pigs are dressed like humans, sometimes famous characters, while others are just covered with plastic. Locals do this to ensure that the lechon won’t be soggy 
                    after the parade.</p>
                <p><b>2. Enjoy the basaan<br></b></p>
                <img src="/./Season/Summer/Phil/lechon3.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; position: relative; left: 165px;">
                <p><br>This is undoubtedly the most fun part of the event because everyone is allowed to douse water to each other, may it be locals, tourists, or just passers-by. It can really test someone’s patience but this event is nothing but fun. A piece of advice though, trust no one! Because you’ll never know who will throw water (
                    sometimes ice-cold) at you!</p>
                <p><b>3. Support local businesses<br></b></p>
                <img src="/./Season/Summer/Phil/lechon4.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; position: relative; left: 165px;">

                <p><br>During the festival, not only the lechons are featured but there are also other famous local delicacies you can try in Balayan like the Bagoong Balayan, a Pinoy condiment produced by fermenting ground scads (galunggong) or anchovies (dilis). 
                    You can also try the famous Batangas Lomi.</p>
